            <h3>How It All Began</h3>
            <p>In 2015, Algolab started as a small initiative to bridge the gap between education and real-world skills. It all began when we provided our first online course to a community center that lacked the resources to train its members in digital skills. Seeing the transformative power of that one effort, we realized the potential to create something far greater: a platform dedicated to equipping individuals with the tools to succeed in a digital-first world.</p>

<p>Today, Algolab has grown into a global force for change. Alongside the millions of learners who explore our self-paced courses, over 30,000 educators deliver our curriculum through 10,000 organizations worldwide. With 95% of our learners finding employment or advancing their education upon completing our courses, our mission is clear: transforming lives through the power of knowledge.</p>

<p>Our thriving ecosystem of partners includes innovators, governments, and organizations across sectors, working together to redefine what’s possible. At Algolab, we’re not just teaching skills—we’re shaping the future.</p>
